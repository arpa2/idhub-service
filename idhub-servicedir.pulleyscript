# idhub-servicedio.pulleyscript
#
# This script pulls data from LDAP, and outputs pairs for the
# relations that matter for the IdentityHub:
#
#  - pseudonym         for mutual seeAlso references
#  - alias             for nested inetOrgPerson entries
#  - group membership  for mutual member/membership
#  - role occupancy    for mutual roleOccupant/occupation
#
# Somewhat more detail is in dit.graphml and dit.pdf
